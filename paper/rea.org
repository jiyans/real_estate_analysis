The aim of this study is to examine the effect that Deep Learning methods could
potentially have on real estate housing. Although there have been quite a few
studies investigating the use of Machine Learning methods for this kind of task.
The novelty in our study primarily lies in the use of Deep Learning methods for
computer vision to analyze the images of the floor plans to assist with
prediction and our analysis of the way the neural network is able to use the
floor plans for prediction. There have been have been quite a few papers about
the use of Machine Learning methods for real estate price predictions, however,
most of the do not make use of deep learning, and even if they do, they do not
make use of the actual floor plan, but mostly rely on structured explanatory
variables for the their models. Some recent examples include,
autocite:park2015using , for the German housing market and
autocite:sangha21_proper_norweg for the Norwegian housing market. In order to compare
our results to other results, we also reconstruct some models often used in the literature
as baseline models.

* TODO Introduction [This is still pretty poorly written]
** Find some nice introduction of why real estate markets matter

The real estate market has some defining features that make it different to
other kinds of markets. For example while competition in growing cities is
always pretty high, the goods sold could hardly be described homogenous /I have
no idea what im saying/.

** Current Real estate models
Most real estate models are based on easily observable features of each kind of
rental apartment, such as the zip-code, the closest station, or the number of
rooms in each apartment.

** We want to consider the room layout
However the actual layout of each apartment could also be considered to a very
important aspect of each apartment, however, since it is hard to describe the
apartment layout precisely in words, in other words, hard to categorize, most
analyses of house prices thus ignore the problem of precisely incorporating
information about the apartment layout.
** 2 main questions
In this paper we will try to answer 2
main questions.

 1. Does having information about the room layout, help with the prediction for
    any model? To test this we will try to predict the price of the apartment
    solely with the CNN
 2. If there is an effect of considering the room layout, how do we build the
    model that is most efficient for prediction.
    1. For example we could use the output of our model together with a linear
       model for the categories, like in 1.
    2. We could make it kinda ensemble like, using the output of multiple
       models, and using another linear model to combine them ( Or other
       ensemble methods )
    3. We could use a multimodal approach, where we output latent states with
       each of our submodels and use a "head" model to fuse our latent states
       as described in:

* Data
The data was collected from the realestate.yahoo.com website, and it includes
only rental apartments in the area around Tokyo, Mita. Thus, our sample is not
perfectly representative of the Tokyo realestate market, and our anlaysis can
not be considered as an analysis of the Tokyo realestate market as a whole, but
rather it serves as a way for us to outline how to use our methods. However, the
results from this paper should not be used for interpretations on the Tokyo real
estate market as a whole.
Two more potential sources of bias in the dataset are that we are only considering
properties that were listed at the time of data collection, and that we rely on
data from a single website, and are not making use of other sources. However, these
biases are not expected to have an impact on our results, in this paper we are more
concerned with the efficacy of the different measures, rather than making statements
about the Tokyo Real-estate market.
** TODO One problem with the data was that the images are too small. We would have liked to use bigger pictures but we weren't able to retrieve the bigger pictures
** Dimensions of data
** Summary stats
** Some histograms
* Models and Methods
** We propose two main models
Even though the data consist of Integers only, we will choose the rent price to be


*** TODO Multimodal model explained in [MULTIMODALPAPER]
*** TODO A model that is very similary to the above multimodal model, however the connection
between the two models is not many nodes, but only a single. Pretrained on the regression task
*** TODO A model with 1 CNN and 1 NN
*** TODO A model with 1 CNN and 1 LN
*** TODO A model with cnn ln and xgboost
*** Explain how we crop our pictures
*** Explain how I will prepare all the variables
*** Explain the embeddings I will use for the Neural Network
*** Explain how the result changes with One hot encodings vs embeddings.
** Baseline models with columns only
*** Multiple Linear Regression
 - [ ] Explain base class of the One hot encoded things and a little bit of multiple linear regression.
   Make the model. If it becomes too long, explain it simply with the vector representation, this probably
   does not have to be too exact.
   \( \hat y = \beta_{0} x_{0} + \beta_{1} x_{1} + \beta_{2} x_{2} \)

*** XGBoost
 - [ ] Same here, show base class of ohe
 - [ ] Show importance only in real paper but not the summary
*** Neural Network
 -  Simply show the results of the summary
** Practical Adjustments
*** At the end of the model we will
*** How do tricks affect the model trainings
*** Exactly explain how the model is trained,
 - Learning rate adjustment
 - Pretrained resnet 50
 - For the categorical ensemble thing, that first the network is trained,
   then weights are frozen, and that only the new head of the resnet50 is trained at first, for a few epochs,
   and at the end we train both models
 - Same for the output
* Results
** Show the results for the baseline models
** Show the results for the other models
** Show all the graphs
 - [ ] In summary show results with regression plots
 - [ ] Show coefficients only in real paper not summary
* Discussion
Some of our results are hard to interpret, e.g. multimodal learning is worse than the ensembling method. (probably) Why?
* Conclusion
** Conclude whether using these models might make sense or not
Some of our
** Further possible investigations
Some possible talking points:
 - If the results are good, would looking at a bigger market be interesting
 - If we had a more representative sample, could we use some of the results to make some
   interesting conclusions
 - It would be interesting to analyze the outputs using methods as described in for example with shap or eli5, to see
   why it doesn't work if it doesn't or what it focuses on for certain predictions, if it does.
 - How does everything look for the multimodal approach, does it make sense or not?
