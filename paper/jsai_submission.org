#+begin_abstract
This report examines whether a consideration of floorplan images of real-estate
apartments can effectively improve real-estate rental price predictions. We use
a modern computer vision technique to predict the rental price of apartments
using the floorplan of the apartment exclusively. Afterward, we use these
predictions combined with a more traditional hedonic pricing method to see
whether its predictions improved. We found that by including the predictions, we
were able to increase the accuracy of the predictions from an \( R^{2} \) of
0.915 to an \( R^{2} \) of 0.945. This improvement suggests that floorplans
contain considerable information about rent prices, not captured in the other
explanatory variables used. Further investigation, including more explanatory
variables about the apartment itself, could be used in future research to
further examine the price structure of real estate and better understand
consumer behavior.

* Introduction
The problem of real estate value estimation comes up frequently in society, and
many agents have incentives for an accurate prediction. Furthermore, we believe
that if it is possible to apply computer vision methods to real estate, it might
open up avenues for further studies into consumer behavior and the structure of
real-estate prices in the future.

The underlying hypothesis of our research is that the floorplans contain
characteristics that are valuable to consumers but are neglected with
traditional methods of price estimation. We hypothesize that it is possible to
leverage these factors by utilizing deep learning. We collected tabular data and
floorplans of over 140,000 rental apartments in the Tokyo Metropolitan area.
Then we devised some minor changes to a widely used neural network architecture
to help with conversion and trained a neural network (NN hereafter) to predict
the rent of an apartment given only its floorplan. Finally, we combined the NN's
prediction with a traditional hedonic regression model and analyzed the effects
of including the NN's predictions. Doing this, we find that the neural network
can explain a considerable proportion of the rent price of many real-estate
properties and improve the explanatory power of the hedonic regression model.
One of the main reasons that the floorplans might contain previously untapped
potential is that studies in real-estate economics tend to find that so-called
"structural" features have more significance in the consumers' eyes than
so-called "environmental" ones. [cite:@choi2003;@akiyamayuki2019230204]

* Methodology
** Data
The dataset used is a mix of tabular and image data of rental real estate
properties listed on a public website from the Tokyo Metropolitan area. The data
was collected by the authors to write this paper. The dataset used has over
140,000 observations, three categorical and seven continuous variables,
including the target variable. As this is primarily an exploratory report, we
limited our dataset to the Tokyo Metropolitan area to sidestep the problem of
having to consider multiple markets. The categorical and continuous variables
are characteristics describing either the building of an apartment or the
apartment itself, such as Apartment size, Number of floors, or the name of the
closest train station.
Figure [[fig:example]]  shows some floorplans and their corresponding targets. The target
is the log of the rent price in 10000 Yen units.

** Neural Network Architecture
For the construction of the Neural Network, we relied on the software libraries
~fastai~ [cite:@howard20_fastai], ~pytorch~ and ~torchvision~. (Pytorch and
torchvision both by the PyTorch team [cite:@NEURIPS2019_9015]). We built on the
~resnet50~ implementation by [cite:@NEURIPS2019_9015] of the model outlined in
[cite:@he15:deep_resid_learn_image_recog]. We initialized the model's weights to
the pre-trained weights available in ~torchvision~. These weights are trained
using the "ImageNet" [cite:@imagenet2009] dataset. We replaced the last layers
with a custom head to better fit the regression task at hand. We used the same
base model up until the first fully connected layer, after which we replaced all
layers with a custom head. We modified the final modified to scale its output
between a predetermined range, to avoid exploding gradients.

We used the mean squared error as a loss function. Initially we trained the
newly created layers exclusively, and afterwards we unfroze unfroze the
pre-trained weights and trained the whole neural network. The model was
optimized with Adam [cite:@kingma2017adam].

** Hedonic Price Estimation
The hedonic price estimation was performed via a multiple linear regression (MLR
hereafter) model using all variables collected. We log-transform the target
variable of apartment rent (in 10000 Yen units). We created dummy matrices for
each of our categorical variables, ending up with 724 columns, including the
intercept and continuous columns. The "station" variable's cardinality of 684
and the "Style" variable's cardinality of 31 caused this significant increase in
dimension. Furthermore, we added a squared term for the "Time to station"
variable to the design matrix.

* Results
We estimated three different models, one using all variables, without the rent
prediction of the Neural Network, one using all variables with the rent
prediction of the neural network, using only the neural network and an
intercept. Table [[tab:regression]] shows the results for these three models on
different parts of the dataset. We performed an 80-to-20 train-to-test split based on
the buildings, not apartments, to avoid information leakage.

|----------------------------+---------+---------+--------|
We observe a considerable increase in the model's predictive power using the
NN's predictions over the one that does not include the NN's predictions. We can
see that the \(R^{2} \) value improves after including the predictions from the
NN, from 0.915 to 0.945, on the total dataset, and 0.914 to 0.923 on the
test data set. The residual standard error on the total dataset was reduced from
0.127 to 0.101, a reduction in error of \( \approx 20\% \).

* Discussion

We suppose that the reasons for the effectiveness of the neural network are as follows: Firstly, by using the floorplans, the neural network had access to
information that influences rent and residential satisfaction [cite:@choi2003]
of a particular real estate. Thus, it can find features that affect rent that
are not available in the tabular dataset and leverage them for prediction.
However, the increase in explanatory power partly also stems from the simplicity of
our dataset. While we had a sizable amount of apartments and floorplans, we had
fewer explanatory variables than other studies on hedonic pricing of real-estate rent prediction. Furthermore, we only used apartments from the Tokyo Metropolitan area.

We presume that by using more variables about the apartments' structural
features, the regression models' predictive power would increase, and the
influence of the NN in the same model would decrease. Moreover, because we
only included information from the Tokyo metropolitan area, the
discrepancies in rent based solely on the location were comparatively small.
This study was exploratory only, and further investigation might include how to
deal with the problem of different markets.

* Conclusion
We showed that it is possible to effectively leverage floorplan images to
improve the prediction of rent prices by using computer vision techniques and
that we can enhance more traditional models' predictive power. We could not test
the effectiveness of floorplan images to models using a wider variety of tabular
data due to the unavailability of that data. We suspect that using floorplan
data could be an option in situations where apartment-level tabular data is not
available but floorplans are and that this paper shows initial evidence for the
practicality of using computer vision in such situations.
