This study strives to examine whether consideration of floorplan images of
real-estate apartments could be effective for improving real-estate rental price
predictions. We use a modern computer vision technique to predict the
rental price of apartments using the floorplan of the apartment exclusively.
Afterward, we use these predictions combined with a more traditional
hedonic pricing method to see whether its predictions improved. We found that
by including the predictions, we were able to increase the accuracy of the
predictions from an \( R^{2} \) of 0.915 to an \( R^{2} \) of 0.945. This
suggests that floorplans contain considerable information about rent
prices, not captured in the other explanatory variables used. Further
investigation, including more explanatory variables about the apartment itself,
could be used in future research to examine the price structure of real
estate further and better understand consumer behavior.

* Introduction
In this paper we look into the opportunities of the application of new computer
vision techniques to the problem of real-estate rental price estimation. The
problem of real estate value estimation comes up often times in society, and
many agents have incentives for an accurate prediction. Furthermore, we believe
that if it is possible to apply computer vision methods to real-estate, it might
open up venues for further studies into consumer behavior and the structure of
real-estate prices in the future.

The underlying hypothesis of our research is that the floorplans contain
characteristics that are valuable to consumers, but are neglected with
traditional methods of price estimation. Furthermore, we hypothesize that some
of these factors could be leveraged with deep learning. To test our hypothesis,
we collected tabular data and floorplans of over 140,000 rental apartments in
the Tokyo Metropolitan area. Then we devised some minor changes to a widely used
neural network architecture and trained a neural network (NN hereafter) to
predict the rent of an apartment given only its floorplan. Finally, we combined
the NN's prediction with a traditional hedonic regression model and analyzed the
effects of including the NN's predictions.

Doing this, we find that the neural network can explain a considerable
proportion of the rent price of many real-estate properties and considerably
improve the explanatory power of the hedonic regression model. Including the
neural network does not overly take away explanatory power from variables that
would be considered important in a more traditional model or affect those
variables in other unexpected ways, arguably showing that the NN captures
previously unconsidered factors.

One of the main reasons, we think that the floorplans might contain
previously untapped potential, is that economics studies tend to find that
so-called "structural" features have more significance in the consumers' eyes
than so-called "environmental" ones. [cite:@choi2003;@akiyama_yuki2019320204]

* Methodology
** Data
The dataset used is a mix of tabular and image data of rental real estate
properties listed on a public website from the Tokyo Metropolitan area. The data
was collected by the authors to write this paper. The dataset used has over
140,000 observations, three categorical and seven continuous variables including
the target variable. As this is primarily an exploratory report, we limited our
dataset to the Tokyo Metropolitan area, to sidestep the problem of having to
consider multiple markets.
The categorical and continuous variables are characteristics describing either
the building of an apartment or the apartment itself, such as Apartment size, Number
of floors, or the name of the closest train station.

** Neural Network architecture
For the construction of the Neural Network, we relied on the software libraries
~fastai~ [cite:@howard20_fastai], ~pytorch~ and ~torchvision~. (Pytorch and
torchvision both by the PyTorch team [cite:@NEURIPS2019_9015]). We built on the
~resnet50~ implementation by [cite:@NEURIPS2019_9015] of the model outlined in
[cite:@he15:deep_resid_learn_image_recog]. We initialized the model's weights
to the pre-trained weights available in ~torchvision~. These weights are trained
using the "ImageNet" [cite:@imagenet2009] dataset.

We replaced the last layers with a custom adaptation to better fit the
regression task at hand. We used the same base model up until the first fully
connected layer, after which we replaced all layers with a custom head.
Initially, we used a fully connected layer with a single output as the final
layer. However, we found that sometimes, the model would make exceedingly high
predictions, which complicated the model training by abnormally increasing the
loss, resulting in exploding gradients. Thus, we decided to modify the final
layer to scale the Neural Network's output between a predetermined range. The
last layer's were scaled with a sigmoid function. By scaling the outputs of the
neural network, we could prevent these problems at the expense of introducing
one hyperparameter, the y-range. To decide on the y-range for our neural
network, we used the log-transformed target variable's greatest lower and least
upper integer bounds. Since the extreme values were 0.095, and 5.521, we chose 0
and 6 as our bounds. This layer scales the output vector from the Network
elementwise according to the following rule. \(s(x) = \sigma(x) (h - l) + l \),
where \( \sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}} \), \( l \) is the lower bound, and \( h
\) is the upper bound. The outputs of this function are then used to calculate
the loss, ensuring that initial predictions of the network are never
unreasonably high, ultimately resulting in easier training and convergence.

We used the mean squared error as a loss function, and before training the whole
model, we froze the base model and trained the custom head only. After initial
rounds of training the head only, we "unfroze" the pre-trained weights and
trained the whole neural network. The model was optimized with Adam
[cite:@kingma2017adam], and the learning rate schedule an initial learning rate
was chosen as suggested in
[cite:@smith17_cyclic_learn_rates_train_neural_networ].

** Hedonic Price estimation
The hedonic price estimation was performed via a multiple linear regression
model using all variables collected. We log-transform the target variable of
apartment rent. We created dummy matrices for each of our categorical variables,
ending up with 724 columns, including the intercept and continuous columns. The
"station" variable's cardinality of 684 and the "Style" variable's cardinality
of 31 caused this significant increase in dimension. Furthermore, we added a
squared term for the "Time to station" variable to the design matrix.


* WIP Results
We estimated three different models, one using all variables, without the rent
prediction of the Neural Network, one using all variables with the rent
prediction of the neural network, using only the neural network and an
intercept.

* WIP Discussion

Our discussion section consists of two parts. The first part discusses the
predictions of the models, the shortcomings of the models, and some potential
remedies. The second part discusses the overall results of our paper in a general
sense. In the paper, more examples for the model's predictions are given, however,
for the sake of brevity, we only show a single example in this summary.

For this example we will look at the greatest upward movements due to the
predictions of the neural network.

It depicts all private rooms, as well as the public rooms everyone living there
may use. For this realestate property, the prediction of the first model much
more accurate than the other two. This is because the neural network
overestimated the rent by a lot. The reason for the NN's overestimation might be
that the neural network was considering the floorplan as a whole, while the
actual apartment available for rent is only a single room. A similar problem
seems to have occurred with the third floorplan, which displays the apartment's
floorplan and a balcony that everyone living in the building can use. The
reasons for the high upward shift in the second and fourth floorplans are much
harder to discern. The problem of the first and third images described above, is
correctly handled in some other images further outlined in the main paper.

We suppose that the reason for the effectiveness of the neural network is twofold:
1. By using the floorplans, the neural network had access to information that
   influences rent and residential satisfaction [cite:@choi2003] of a particular
   real estate. Thus it can find features that influence rent that are not
   available in the tabular dataset, and leverage these for its prediction.
2. The increase in explanatory power seems extraordinarily high because of our
   relatively simple dataset. While we had a sizable amount of apartments and
   floorplans, we had much fewer explanatory variables than other studies on
   hedonic pricing. Furthermore, we only had apartments from the Tokyo
   Metropolitan area.
To further expand on the second point, most studies we reviewed made use of many
more explanatory variables, especially about structural features of the
apartments. We presume that by using more variables, the regression models'
predictive power would increase, and the weight of the NN in the same model
would decrease. However, in situations where it might be easier to obtain
floorplans of apartments rather than the tabular data of the categorical
features, an approach utilizing computer vision might be worth considering. So
our method could be used by entities who do not have the resources to gather a
dataset of tabular features but could obtain the floorplans.

This study was exploratory only, and further investigation might include how this
method fares with floorplans in different markets. The current dataset only
includes a limited area of rental apartments in and around Tokyo. This, however,
means that the rent prices we encountered did not deviate as much as they would
when considering more markets. We can easily imagine that bigger discrepancies
in rent amount due to location only could disturb our model. The same problem,
less pronounced, is present in the current dataset already because apartments
with mostly the same layout in different locations will have different prices.
One potential remedy for this problem could be training the model on the
residuals of a multiple linear regression controlling for location. Doing this,
it might be possible to reduce some of the effects of location on rent.

Another problem with Neural networks, in general, is that they are hard to
interpret, which also applies to the current study. We have trouble explaining
why the model is making some of its predictions. [cite:@NIPS2017_7062], for
example, provide an approach for general black-box model interpretation, which
has also applied to computer vision. Analyzing the current model using
the technique outlined there might give us more insight into its internals and
observe its focus when making predictions. This, in turn, might lead to insights
into consumer behavior.

* Conclusion
We used publicly available real estate data to train a residual-based
convolutional neural network to predict rent prices based solely on that
properties' floorplan. We proposed some tweaks to enhance the original model to
allow for quicker training and convergence in the case of real-estate
prediction. We showed that it is possible to effectively leverage floorplan
images to improve the prediction of rent prices and that these predictions can
enhance other more traditional models' predictive power. We only had limited
access to detailed information at the apartment level and thus could not test
the effectiveness of floorplan image analysis against models making use of a
wider variety of tabular data. We suspect that using floorplan data could be an
option for entities trying to estimate rent prices without the need for
interviewing participants or employing other costly means of gaining
apartment-level information. Our results seem to be in line with existing
literature on the topic of real-estate price composition. Lastly, we believe
that this paper shows initial evidence that using computer vision for rent
prediction in low data-availability situations can be practical.
