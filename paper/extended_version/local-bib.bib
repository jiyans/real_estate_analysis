@article{howard20_fastai,
  abstract        = {fastai is a deep learning library which provides
                  practitioners with high-level components that can quickly and
                  easily provide state-of-the-art results in standard deep
                  learning domains, and provides researchers with low-level
                  components that can be mixed and matched to build new
                  approaches. It aims to do both things without substantial
                  compromises in ease of use, flexibility, or performance. This
                  is possible thanks to a carefully layered architecture, which
                  expresses common underlying patterns of many deep learning and
                  data processing techniques in terms of decoupled abstractions.
                  These abstractions can be expressed concisely and clearly by
                  leveraging the dynamism of the underlying Python language and
                  the flexibility of the PyTorch library. fastai includes: a new
                  type dispatch system for Python along with a semantic type
                  hierarchy for tensors; a GPU-optimized computer vision library
                  which can be extended in pure Python; an optimizer which
                  refactors out the common functionality of modern optimizers
                  into two basic pieces, allowing optimization algorithms to be
                  implemented in 4-5 lines of code; a novel 2-way callback
                  system that can access any part of the data, model, or
                  optimizer and change it at any point during training; a new
                  data block API; and much more. We have used this library to
                  successfully create a complete deep learning course, which we
                  were able to write more quickly than using previous
                  approaches, and the code was more clear. The library is
                  already in wide use in research, industry, and teaching. NB:
                  This paper covers fastai v2, which is currently in pre-release
                  at http://dev.fast.ai/},
