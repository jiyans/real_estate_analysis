	abstract = {Why did policymakers adopt the gold standard? Although previous research has identified ex post effects of gold standard adoption on trade and bond yields, few studies have sought to understand whether these were the actual outcomes of interest to policymakers at the time of adoption. We examine the political economy of Japan's adoption of the gold standard in 1897 by exploring the ex ante motives of policymakers as well as how the legislative decision to adopt gold won approval. We then link the beliefs of contemporaneous policymakers to data so that we can test the economic effects of adoption. In contrast to previous studies examining bond yields, we find little evidence that joining the gold standard reduced Japan's country risk or investors anticipated a dramatic decline in borrowing rates for the government. Moreover, we find no evidence of a domestic investment boom or that investors anticipated one and bid it into stock prices. However, as some policymakers suggested, we find that membership in the gold standard increased Japan's exports by lowering transactions costs and because the price of gold fell relative to silver, making exports to silver standard countries more competitive. While Japan also received a boost in exports to its regional trading partners when it switched from paper to silver, going onto gold allowed Japan to tap into the growing share of global trade that was centered on the gold standard: by the late 1890s nearly 60 percent of Japanese exports and total trade were with members of the gold club.},

	abstract = {Our experience of the world is multimodal - we see objects,
                  hear sounds, feel texture, smell odors, and taste flavors.
                  Modality refers to the way in which something happens or is
                  experienced and a research problem is characterized as
                  multimodal when it includes multiple such modalities. In order
                  for Artificial Intelligence to make progress in understanding
                  the world around us, it needs to be able to interpret such
                  multimodal signals together. Multimodal machine learning aims
                  to build models that can process and relate information from
                  multiple modalities. It is a vibrant multi-disciplinary field
                  of increasing importance and with extraordinary potential.
                  Instead of focusing on specific multimodal applications, this
                  paper surveys the recent advances in multimodal machine
                  learning itself and presents them in a common taxonomy. We go
                  beyond the typical early and late fusion categorization and
                  identify broader challenges that are faced by multimodal
                  machine learning, namely: representation, translation,
                  alignment, fusion, and co-learning. This new taxonomy will
                  enable researchers to better understand the state of the field

                  fairness. Serial cross-sectional data (April 14 to May 26,
                  2020) from nearly 7,000 German participants demonstrate that
                  implementing a mandatory policy increased actual compliance
                  despite moderate acceptance; mask wearing correlated
                  positively with other protective behaviors. A preregistered

	abstract = {To contain the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
                  pandemic, health and government authorities have imposed
                  sweeping selfquarantine orders for communities worldwide.
                  Health officials assume that the public will have high rates
                  of compliance. However, studies suggest that a major obstacle
                  to compliance for household quarantine is concern about loss
                  of income. A cross-sectional study of the adult population of
                  Israel was conducted in the last week of February 2020 to
                  assess public attitudes toward the COVID-19 outbreak. In
                  particular, public compliance rates with self-quarantine were
                  assessed, depending on whether lost wages would be compensated
                  for. When compensation was assumed, the compliance rate was 94
                  percent. When compensation was removed, the compliance rate
                  dropped to less than 57 percent. This study demonstrated that
                  providing people with assurances about their livelihoods
                  during self-quarantine is an important component of compliance
                  with public health regulations.},

	abstract = {Viewability is one of the most important metrics used in
                  adtech to measure the performance quality of ad campaigns. The
                  viewability standard defines the visibility conditions an ad
                  impression must meet to achieve a su cient marketing e ect to
                  be considered viewed. The ad-tech industry o ers opaque
                  measures of viewability whose performance is questionable. To
                  address this issue, we propose a novel methodology for
                  measuring viewability in ad campaigns. The disclosure of the
                  functional details of this technique makes it reproducible and
                  auditable. Our solution has been deployed in production by a
                  Demand Side Platform (DSP) to measure the viewability rate of
                  the ad campaigns. Leveraging the infrastructure of this DSP,
                  we compare the performance of our methodology with a
                  commercial solution. Both techniques report a similar overall
                  viewability rate of 50\%. However, our solution measured the
                  viewability in 93\% of the ads served by the DSP, unlike to
                  74\% of the ads measured by the commercial solution. A rough

@article{carisNudgingImproveHand2018,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hand hygiene is paramount to prevent
                  healthcare-associated infections, but improving compliance is
                  challenging. When healthcare workers seldom encounter
                  healthcare-associated infections, they will consider the odds
                  of causing infections through poor hand hygiene negligible.
                  Cognitive biases such as these may induce non-compliance.
                  Nudging, 'a friendly push to encourage desired behaviour',
                  could provide an easily implemented, inexpensive measure to
                  address cognitive biases and thus support hand hygiene
                  interventions. AIM: To investigate whether behavioural nudges,
                  displayed as posters, can increase the use of alcohol-based
                  hand rub. METHODS: We developed nudges based on a systematic
                  review of previously described cognitive biases, and tested
                  these through a cross-sectional survey among the target
                  audience. We then conducted a controlled before-after trial on
                  two hospital wards, to assess the effect of these nudges on
                  the use of alcohol-based hand rub, measured with electronic
                  dispensers. FINDINGS: Poisson regression analyses adjusted for
                  workload showed that nudges displayed next to dispensers
                  increased their overall use on one ward [poster 1: relative
                  risk: 1.6 (95\% confidence interval: 1.2-2.2); poster 2: 1.7
                  (1.2-2.5)] and during doctor's rounds on both wards [poster 1:
                  ward A: 1.7 (1.1-2.6); ward B: 2.2 (1.3-3.8)]. Use of
                  dispensers without adjacent nudges did not increase.
                  CONCLUSION: Nudges based on cognitive biases that play a role
                  in hand hygiene, and displayed as posters, could provide an
                  easy, inexpensive measure to increase use of alcohol-based
                  hand rub. When applying nudges to change behaviour, it is
                  important to identify the right nudge for the right audience.},

	abstract = {Mobile symptom tracking The rapidity with which severe
                  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads
                  through a population is defying attempts at tracking it, and
                  quantitative polymerase chain reaction testing so far has been
                  too slow for real-time epidemiology. Taking advantage of
                  existing longitudinal health care and research patient
                  cohorts, Drew et al. pushed software updates to participants
                  to encourage reporting of potential coronavirus disease 2019
                  (COVID-19) symptoms. The authors recruited about 2 million
                  users (including health care workers) to the COVID Symptom
                  Study (previously known as the COVID Symptom Tracker) from
                  across the United Kingdom and the United States. The
                  prevalence of combinations of symptoms (three or more),
                  including fatigue and cough, followed by diarrhea, fever,
                  and/or anosmia, was predictive of a positive test verification
                  for SARS-CoV-2. As exemplified by data from Wales, United
                  Kingdom, mathematical modeling predicted geographical hotspots
                  of incidence 5 to 7 days in advance of official public health

                  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe
                  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents
                  challenges to the robust collection of population-scale data
                  to address this global health crisis. We established the
                  COronavirus Pandemic Epidemiology (COPE) Consortium to unite
                  scientists with expertise in big data research and
                  epidemiology to develop the COVID Symptom Study, previously
                  known as the COVID Symptom Tracker, mobile application. This
                  application---which offers data on risk factors, predictive
                  symptoms, clinical outcomes, and geographical hotspots---was
                  launched in the United Kingdom on 24 March 2020 and the United
                  States on 29 March 2020 and has garnered more than 2.8 million
                  users as of 2 May 2020. Our initiative offers a proof of
                  concept for the repurposing of existing approaches to enable
                  rapidly scalable epidemiologic data collection and analysis,
                  which is critical for a data-driven response to this public
                  health challenge. A mobile app, the COVID Symptom Study,
                  offers data on risk factors, early symptoms, clinical

@article{howard17_mobil,
	abstract = {We present a class of efficient models called MobileNets
                  for mobile and embedded vision applications. MobileNets are
                  based on a streamlined architecture that uses depth-wise
                  separable convolutions to build light weight deep neural
                  networks. We introduce two simple global hyper-parameters that
                  efficiently trade off between latency and accuracy. These
                  hyper-parameters allow the model builder to choose the right
                  sized model for their application based on the constraints of
                  the problem. We present extensive experiments on resource and
                  accuracy tradeoffs and show strong performance compared to
                  other popular models on ImageNet classification. We then
                  demonstrate the effectiveness of MobileNets across a wide
                  range of applications and use cases including object
                  detection, finegrain classification, face attributes and large
                  scale geo-localization.},

@article{howard20_fastai,
	abstract = {fastai is a deep learning library which provides
                  practitioners with high-level components that can quickly and
                  easily provide state-of-the-art results in standard deep
                  learning domains, and provides researchers with low-level
                  components that can be mixed and matched to build new
                  approaches. It aims to do both things without substantial
                  compromises in ease of use, flexibility, or performance. This
                  is possible thanks to a carefully layered architecture, which
                  expresses common underlying patterns of many deep learning and
                  data processing techniques in terms of decoupled abstractions.
                  These abstractions can be expressed concisely and clearly by
                  leveraging the dynamism of the underlying Python language and
                  the flexibility of the PyTorch library. fastai includes: a new
                  type dispatch system for Python along with a semantic type
                  hierarchy for tensors; a GPU-optimized computer vision library
                  which can be extended in pure Python; an optimizer which
                  refactors out the common functionality of modern optimizers
                  into two basic pieces, allowing optimization algorithms to be
                  implemented in 4-5 lines of code; a novel 2-way callback
                  system that can access any part of the data, model, or
                  optimizer and change it at any point during training; a new
                  data block API; and much more. We have used this library to
                  successfully create a complete deep learning course, which we
                  were able to write more quickly than using previous
                  approaches, and the code was more clear. The library is
                  already in wide use in research, industry, and teaching. NB:

@article{lin17_focal_loss_dense_objec_detec,
	abstract = {The highest accuracy object detectors to date are based on
                  a two-stage approach popularized by R-CNN, where a classifier
                  is applied to a sparse set of candidate object locations. In
                  contrast, one-stage detectors that are applied over a regular,
                  dense sampling of possible object locations have the potential
                  to be faster and simpler, but have trailed the accuracy of
                  two-stage detectors thus far. In this paper, we investigate
                  why this is the case. We discover that the extreme
                  foreground-background class imbalance encountered during
                  training of dense detectors is the central cause. We propose
                  to address this class imbalance by reshaping the standard
                  cross entropy loss such that it down-weights the loss assigned
                  to well-classified examples. Our novel Focal Loss focuses
                  training on a sparse set of hard examples and prevents the
                  vast number of easy negatives from overwhelming the detector
                  during training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our loss, we
                  design and train a simple dense detector we call RetinaNet.
                  Our results show that when trained with the focal loss,
                  RetinaNet is able to match the speed of previous one-stage
                  detectors while surpassing the accuracy of all existing
                  state-of-the-art two-stage detectors. Code is at:

@article{mishraSocialDistancingCOVID192020,
	abstract = {Social distancing refers to a host of public health
                  measures aimed at reducing social interaction between people
                  based on touch or physical proximity. It is a
                  non-pharmaceutical intervention to slow the spread of
                  infectious diseases in the communities. It becomes
                  particularly important as a community mitigation strategy
                  before vaccines or drugs become widely available. This essay
                  describes how a protracted adherence to social distancing
                  guidelines could affect the Indian society. Changes are
                  expected in some of the prevalent cultural norms such as
                  personal space and common good. Gender relations within the
                  family are likely to change in favour of greater sharing of
                  domestic responsibilities between men and women. Older adults
                  may particularly experience stress due to social distancing
                  because of their physical dependency and emotional
                  vulnerability. Working patterns are likely to become more
                  flexible and promotive of social distancing. Human interaction
                  based on digital technology is likely to increase. The
                  implications for public health in India due to such changes
                  are also discussed.},

@report{pennycookFightingCOVID19Misinformation2020,
	abstract = {Across two studies with over 1,600 U.S. adults recruited
                  online, we present evidence that people share false claims
                  about COVID-19 partly because they simply fail to think
                  sufficiently about whether or not content is accurate when
                  deciding what to share. In Study 1, participants were far
                  worse at discerning between true and false content when
                  deciding what they would share on social media relative to
                  when they are asked directly about accuracy. Furthermore,
                  cognitive reflection and science knowledge were associated
                  with stronger discernment. In Study 2, we found that a simple
                  accuracy reminder at the beginning of the study -- i.e.,
                  judging the accuracy of a non-COVID-19-related headline -- more
                  than doubled the level of truth discernment in participants'
                  sharing intentions. Our results, which mirror those found
                  previously for political fake news, suggest that nudging
                  people to think about accuracy is a simple way to improve
                  choices about what to share on social media.},

@article{reedWillingnessAcceptTradeOffs2020,
	abstract = {Objective To conduct a discrete-choice experiment to
                  quantify Americans' acceptance of severe acute respiratory
                  syndrome coronavirus 2 infection risks for earlier lifting of
                  social-distancing restrictions and diminishing the pandemic's
                  economic impact. Methods We designed a discrete-choice
                  experiment to administer 10 choice questions to each
                  respondent representing experimentally controlled pairs of
                  scenarios defined by when nonessential businesses could reopen
                  (May, July, or October 2020), cumulative percentage of
                  Americans contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
                  through 2020 (2\% to 20\%), time for economic recovery (2 to 5
                  years), and the percentage of US households falling below the
                  poverty threshold (16\% to 25\%). Respondents were recruited
                  by SurveyHealthcareGlobus. Results A total of 5953 adults
                  across all 50 states completed the survey between May 8 and
                  20, 2020. Latent-class analysis supported a 4-class model. The
                  largest class (36\%) represented COVID-19 risk-minimizers,
                  reluctant to accept any increases in COVID-19 risks. About
                  26\% were waiters, strongly preferring to delay reopening
                  nonessential businesses, independent of COVID-19 risk levels.
                  Another 25\% represented recovery-supporters, primarily
                  concerned about time required for economic recovery. This
                  group would accept COVID-19 risks as high as 16\% (95\% CI:
                  13\%-19\%) to shorten economic recovery from 3 to 2 years. The
                  final openers class prioritized lifting social distancing
                  restrictions, accepting of COVID-19 risks greater than 20\% to
                  open in May rather than July or October. Political
                  affiliation, race, household income, and employment status
                  were all associated with class membership (P{$<$}.01).
                  Conclusion Americans have diverse preferences pertaining to
                  social-distancing restrictions, infection risks, and economic
                  outcomes. These findings can assist elected and public-health
                  officials in making difficult policy decisions related to the

	abstract = {{$<$}h3{$><$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Gastric cancer is the
                  third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The
                  regulatory mechanisms underlying gastric cancer cell
                  proliferation are largely unclear. Here, we show that the
                  transcription factor GFI1 is associated with advanced clinical
                  gastric cancer progression and promoted gastric cancer cell
                  proliferation partially through inhibition of gastrokine-2
                  (GKN2) transcription. GFI1 was a degrading substrate of FBXW7,
                  whose loss was observed in gastric cancer. Mechanistically,
                  GSK3β-mediated GFI1 S94/S98 phosphorylation triggered its
                  interaction with FBXW7, resulting in SCFFBXW7-mediated
                  ubiquitination and degradation. A nondegradable GFI1 S94A/S98A
                  mutant was more potent in driving gastric cancer cell
                  proliferation and tumorigenesis than wild-type GFI1. Overall,
                  this study reveals the oncogenic role of GFI1 in gastric
                  cancer and provides mechanistic insights into the tumor
                  suppressor function of

	abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the current COVID-19
                  pandemic. A major virulence factor of SARS-CoVs is the
                  nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) which suppresses host gene
                  expression by ribosome association. Here, we show that Nsp1
                  from SARS-CoV-2 binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit, resulting
                  in shutdown of mRNA translation both in vitro and in cells.
                  Structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of
                  in vitro reconstituted Nsp1-40S and various native Nsp1-40S
                  and -80S complexes revealed that the Nsp1 C terminus binds to
                  and obstructs the mRNA entry tunnel. Thereby, Nsp1 effectively
                  blocks RIG-I-dependent innate immune responses that would
                  otherwise facilitate clearance of the infection. Thus, the
                  structural characterization of the inhibitory mechanism of
                  Nsp1 may aid structure-based drug design against SARS-CoV-2.},

@article{wang20_high_temper_high_humid_reduc,
	abstract = {With the ongoing global pandemic of COVID-19, a question is
                  whether the coming summer in the northern hemisphere will
                  reduce the transmission intensity of COVID-19 with increased
                  humidity and temperature. In this paper, we investigate this
                  problem using the data from the cases with symptom-onset dates
                  from January 19 to February 10, 2020 for 100 Chinese cities,
                  and cases with confirmed dates from March 15 to April 25 for
                  1,005 U.S. counties. Statistical analysis is performed to
                  assess the relationship between the transmissibility of
                  COVID-19 and the temperature/humidity, by controlling for
                  various demographic, socio-economic, geographic, healthcare
                  and policy factors and correcting for cross-sectional
                  correlation. We find a similar influence of the temperature
                  and relative humidity on effective reproductive number (R
                  values) of COVID-19 for both China and the U.S. before
                  lockdown in both countries: one-degree Celsius increase in
                  temperature reduces R value by about 0.023 (0.026 (95 \% CI
                  [-0.0395,-0.0125]) in China and 0.020 (95 \% CI [-0.0311,
                  -0.0096]) in the U.S.), and one percent relative humidity rise
                  reduces R value by 0.0078 (0.0076 (95 \% CI [-0.0108,-0.0045])
                  in China and 0.0080 (95 \% CI [-0.0150,-0.0010]) in the U.S.).
                  If assuming a 30 degree and 25 percent increase in temperature
                  and relative humidity from winter to summer in the northern
                  hemisphere, we expect the R values to decline about 0.89 (0.69
                  by temperature and 0.20 by humiditys). Given the notion that
                  the non-intervened R values are around 2.5 to 3, only weather
                  factors cannot make the R values below their critical
                  condition of R<1, under which the epidemic diminishes
                  gradually. Therefore, public health intervention such as
                  social distancing is crucial to block the transmission of
                  COVID-19 even in summer.},

@article{wilsonUsingTransitAdvertising2020,
	abstract = {Out-of-home advertising has the potential to facilitate
                  informal consumer learning about important societal issues. To
                  test this idea, the authors developed an in-market, 14-month
                  transit advertising campaign to educate commuters about
                  climate change and influence attitudes and beliefs on the
                  issue. A unique brand identity, fully functioning website,
                  Facebook page, and Twitter account were created to increase
                  the legitimacy of the campaign. Study results find that the
                  campaign was successful in changing climate change beliefs,
                  increasing optimism about climate change mitigation, and
                  driving commuters to the website where additional information
                  about climate change could be found. Beyond increasing our
                  understanding of social advertising, the study also broadens
                  our understanding of how out-of-home advertising works to
                  increase brand and ad recognition and influence behavior over
                  time and in a naturalistic environment. Ad design and
                  execution strategies are offered to improve the persuasive
                  impact of both out-of-home advertising and informal education

	abstract = {Since the advent of online real estate database companies like Zillow,
  Trulia and Redfin,
  the problem of automatic estimation of market values for houses has received considerable attention. Several real estate websites provide such estimates using a proprietary formula. Although these estimates are often close to the actual sale prices, in some cases they are highly inaccurate. One of the key factors that affects the value of a house is its interior and exterior appearance, which is not considered in calculating automatic value estimates. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of visual characteristics of a house on its market value. Using deep convolutional neural networks on a large dataset of photos of home interiors and exteriors, we develop a method for estimating the luxury level of real estate photos. We also develop a novel framework for automated value assessment using the above photos in addition to home characteristics including size, offered price and number of bedrooms. Finally, by applying our proposed method for price estimation to a new dataset of real estate photos and metadata, we show that it outperforms Zillow's estimates.},

author = {Jon P. Nelson},
abstract = {This paper uses a two-step estimation procedure suggested by Sherwin Rosen to estimate structural demand and supply equations for urban air quality. In the first step, a hedonic price equation is estimated for residential property values for the Washington, D. C., SMSA for 1970. In the second step, a set of marginal hedonic prices is generated. These prices and the quantity of clean air (reciprocal of air pollution) are used as endogenous variables in a simultaneous equation model. Empirical results indicate a price elasticity of demand between −1.2 and −1.4 and a unitary income elasticity.}
